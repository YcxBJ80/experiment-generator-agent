## Contributing to the docs

- Keep guides concise and task-focused. If a page grows beyond ~150 lines, consider splitting it.
- Cross-link related documents using relative paths so everything remains navigable after cloning.
- Prefer English for all documentation and log messages to keep the repo globally accessible.

If you add a new guide, remember to update the table above so newcomers can discover it easily.***
