# Experiment Visualizer Wiki

Welcome to the Experiment Visualizer knowledge base. This wiki mirrors the highlights from `/docs` so contributors can browse the essentials directly on GitHub.

## Quick links

- [Getting Started](./Getting-Started.md) – install prerequisites, configure environment variables, and run the stack locally.
- [Architecture Overview](./Architecture.md) – tour the code layout and core data flows.
- [Streaming Pipeline](./Streaming.md) – understand how Server-Sent Events travel from backend to frontend.
- [Troubleshooting & Operations](./Operations.md) – review past fixes and operational tips.

## Contributing

1. Update the corresponding file inside `docs/wiki/`.
2. Once merged, copy the Markdown into the GitHub project wiki to keep both sources in sync.
3. Ensure internal links remain relative (they already target sibling wiki pages).***
